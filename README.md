# Nix project template for Idris2 JavaScript projects

Acquire Idris; [disregard](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/javascript.html) JavaScript.

Run dev server,

```sh
bin/run # Or Ctrl+Shift+B in VSCode
```

This starts a compilation watch (that recompiles JS on source change), and runs the live-server on the resulting assets. You get a live reloading page on the browser as result, which updates as the Idris source changes.
